# Simple Todo App

This projects criteria was to take a to do app and transfer code using OOP principles that translate into a functional to do list.

## Functionality

This to do app has the funcationality to add to do items with descriptions and dates, check off to do items and also delete to do items.

Additionally I've added functionality of a todo counter that shows how many tasks are on the form and how many are completed.

## Technology

OOP principles were used on the FormValidator.js document to transfer code and set unique Id's for each to do item.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages:
